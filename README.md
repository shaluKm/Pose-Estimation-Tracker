## About
This project develops a pose estimation system using skeleton-based or 3D model-based approaches. By analyzing video or image inputs, the system accurately detects human poses, serving applications in dance, yoga, and wellness. Designed for augmented reality, it enables real-time, precise posture recognition for enhanced user interaction.
